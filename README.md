## 📚 I've been reading...
I graduated from university with a liberal arts degree, in literature. Ironically, I didn't read that much afterwards.
The discovery of my genuine interest in programing magically sparks up my passion in reading again... Guess there are similarities/affinities between human languages and programing languages 💌

Here are the books I've been reading recently:
* Clean code : a handbook of agile software craftsmanship / Robert C. Martin : I take notes in JSON so I can make a random-quote-from-uncle-Bob later. [Repo here](https://github.com/Jennie-QIAN/clean-code-quotes)
